        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>Graphics are very useful for explaining complicated procedures, processes, or providing abstract overviews of concepts.</p>
        <p>Graphics should be kept to a minimum in documents.</p>
        <p>When a reader reads a page their eye is automatically drawn to images and other bold visual cues before they actually start reading the text. Using a graphic in a topic means that a reader is most likely to see that first.</p>
        <p>Graphics can add to the final size of the output file (particularly with JPG files which do not compress much during the output process). Therefore, be aware of the graphics being used in terms of file size.</p>
