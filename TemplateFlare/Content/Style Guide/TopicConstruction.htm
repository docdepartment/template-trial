        <h1 MadCap:autonum="1 ">Topic construction</h1>
        <p>A topic is a single piece of content that covers one subject. This section describes how to construct a topic, the content of a topic and the different types of topics.</p>
        <p>There are three main types of topics. These definitions follow the DITA standards:</p>
        <p class="ul" MadCap:autonum="•"><span class="dt">Concept</span> - Answers the question "What is this about?". </p>
        <p class="ul" MadCap:autonum="•"><span class="dt">Task</span> - Answers the question "How do I ...?".</p>
        <p class="info">This topic must contain a procedure or task description. Each topic must only cover one main task or procedure.</p>
        <p class="ul" MadCap:autonum="•"><span class="dt">Reference</span> - Contains lists and specifications required to support task or concepts.</p>
        <p>Each topic should be self-contained and not cover multiple subjects. Preferably they should only cover one piece of subject matter.</p>
        <p>Topics should not be too long (a page in length).</p>
        <p>Write a topic with single-sourcing in mind. Alter sentences slightly so that they become generic and can be used in multiple locations.</p>
        <p>If required, use conditional text. However, this must be kept to a minimum.</p>
        <p class="xreff" MadCap:autonum="&lt;span style=&quot;color: Gray;&quot; class=&quot;mcFormatColor&quot;&gt;► &lt;/span&gt;">For more information, <MadCap:xref href="../../../../WIP/Content/Style Guide/ConditionalText.htm">See "Conditional text" on page 1</MadCap:xref></p>
        <p>Do not have empty topics; topics with a heading only, unless absolutely necessary for document construction.</p>
