        <p>Graphics are very useful for explaining complicated procedures, processes, or providing abstract overviews of concepts. They can support and enhance instructive texts and should be kept as close to the relevant text as possible. The reader is most likely to see a graphic in a topic  first.</p>
        <p>Graphics can add to the final size of the output file. Be aware of the graphics being used in terms of file size. </p>
        <p>Re-size and edit graphics with an appropriate tool which will not distort or damage the file in any way, such as  Visio or Illustrator.</p>
